# OSMI Mental Health

**Open Sourcing Mental Illness is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. EIN: 81-3587896.**

Link to participate in the 2019 survey: [**OSMI Survey 2019**](https://osmi.typeform.com/to/E1aoi6)

OSMI does [research](https://osmihelp.org/research) on the how mental health is viewed across the tech community. For more information on this, please visit [**OSMIhelp.org**](https://osmihelp.org/)

## Project requirements
 For the purpose of this project, all the currently available datasets have been used. The datasets currently available are from the years **2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.**
The datasets need to be cleaned and combined to carry out any further analysis.  
  
### Project setup  
The project was made on the [**Anaconda Data Science Platform.**](https://www.anaconda.com/)   
Please see [**installation instructions**](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) to learn how to install and configure **Anaconda** for your system.
  
The project files are provided in two formats:

+ **.ipynb** -> for use with [**Jupyter Notebooks**](https://jupyter.org/).
+ **.py** -> for analysis in softwares like [**Spyder IDE.**](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)


#### The original datasets downloaded from OSMI are in the [***datasets***](./datasets) directory.  
#### The cleaned dataset is saved to the [***cleanedDatasets***](./cleanedDatasets) directory.


### Cleaning the dataset

The Jupyter Notebook ***DataCleanup*** deals with the process of cleaning and combining the datasets.

### [**Jupyter Notebook DataCleanup**](./DataCleanup.ipynb)

### Analysing the dataset

The Jupyter Notebook ***DataAnalysis*** deals with the process of analysing the dataset features and studying data trends.

### Supervised Machine Learning

The Jupyter Notebook ***SupervisedLearning*** shows some supervised machine learning models trained on the cleaned dataset.

### [**Jupyter Notebook SupervisedLearning**](./SupervisedLearning.ipynb)

The project is built on ***python3.***
